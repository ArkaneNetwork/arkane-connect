Arkane Web3 Provider
===

> The Arkane Web3 provider is a smart wrapper around the existing Web3 Ethereum JavaScript API.

If you already have an application running using web3 technology, you can make use of this wrapper to leverage the full potential of Arkane Network. 
Your existing infrastructure is just one code block away from being **Arkane Enabled**.
